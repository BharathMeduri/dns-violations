# DVE-2019-0001: some auths respond NXDOMAIN for Empty Non-Terminals

## Description

[RFC 8020](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8020) specifies:

  > This document states clearly that when a DNS resolver receives a response with a response code of NXDOMAIN, it means that the domain name which is thus denied AND ALL THE NAMES UNDER IT do not exist.

Several authoritative servers on the Internet violate this assumption.

They return NXDOMAIN for names that do, in fact, have content sitting under them.
If a resolver honours RFC8020, then having such an NXDOMAIN cached prevents access to the names under it.
If a resolver implements RFC8020 *and* qname minimization, it is guaranteed to hit and cache those NXDOMAINs.
This means that all of the names mentioned below are unavailable to the users of such a resolver.

## Evidence

Evidence is provided here for one instance; a simple list of other offenders, categorized by operator, is below.

As PowerDNS Recursor log output:

```
pdns_recursor[14351]: amp-api-search-edge.apps-lb.itunes-apple.com.akadns.net: Name ‘apps-lb.itunes-apple.com.akadns.net’ and below, is negatively cached via ‘akadns.net’ for another 180 seconds
```

As dnsviz output:
```
global.aliexpress.com.gds.alibabadns.com/CNAME: A query for global.aliexpress.com.gds.alibabadns.com results in a NOERROR response, while a query for its ancestor, com.gds.alibabadns.com, returns a name error (NXDOMAIN), which indicates that subdomains of com.gds.alibabadns.com, including global.aliexpress.com.gds.alibabadns.com, don't exist. (106.11.35.18, 140.205.67.254, 140.205.122.66, 198.11.138.254, UDP_-_EDNS0_4096_D_K)
```

As dig output (two queries):
```

## Proposed fix

Send a correct nodata/NOERROR response for names that have children.

## DNS Operator/Vendor Response

This section has subsection per operator/vendor, listing offending names/servers, and optionally listing the operator's response.

### Akamai

```
pdns_recursor[14351]: amp-api-search-edge.apps-lb.itunes-apple.com.akadns.net: Name ‘apps-lb.itunes-apple.com.akadns.net’ and below, is negatively cached via ‘akadns.net’ for another 180 seconds
```

Akamai is aware of the problem. (2019-10-31)
