# DVE-2017-0008: Cloudflare omits SOA from NOERROR/NODATA response to DS query

## Description

`nominet.uk` is hosted on the Cloudflare DNS servers, and signed.
`info.nominet.uk` is an unsigned delegation to non-Cloudflare DNS servers.

DS queries for `info.nominet.uk` get an RFC 2308 type 3 response from Cloudflare - no SOA nor NS records in the authority section.
The missing SOA prevents negative cacheing from working.

With a DO=1 query, the response includes an NSEC proof of nonexistence and an RRSIG NSEC.
This makes BIND fail to recognize the response as a valid negative response.

Other negative responses from Cloudflare are RFC 2308 type 2, with a SOA.
Unsigned delegations from domains hosted on Cloudflare seem to be rare,
so almost all of their negative responses are OK.

## Proposed fix

Include the SOA and RRSIG SOA in the negative DS response.
