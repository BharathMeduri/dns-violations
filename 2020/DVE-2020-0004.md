# DVE-2020-0004: various nameservers fail to respond correctly to EDNS

## Description

[RFC 2671](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2671) introduces EDNS and [RFC 6891](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6891) clarifies various points.  Section 6.1.2 states:

  > Any OPTION-CODE values not understood by a responder or requestor
  > MUST be ignored.  Specifications of such options might wish to
  > include some kind of signaled acknowledgement.  For example, an
  > option specification might say that if a responder sees and supports
  > option XYZ, it MUST include option XYZ in its response.

As a specific example, [RFC 6975](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6975) introduces DAU, DHU and N3U EDNS option codes.  These option codes are of particular interest as querying a nameserver using any of these option codes should result in the same response regardless of whether the nameserver understands them.

The following zone nameservers fail to respond at all:
* zacks.com
* egslb.homedepot.com

The following zone nameservers, which usually respond with EDNS, drop EDNS completely (not just the option code) but they __do__ respond:
* w<span>ww.</span>e-access.att.com

## Evidence

Evidence is provided here for one nameserver for each zone.  All zone nameservers behave in the same way.

* *zacks.com*:

        ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

* w<span>ww.</span>e-access.att.com:

  Note, `www.e-access.att.com` nameservers incorrectly respond to apex __SOA__ and __NS__ lookups with no answer and no __SOA__, so it is not possible to query the __NS__ RRset through a resolver.

## Proposed fix

Nameservers should ignore EDNS option codes that are not understood.

## DNS Operator/Vendor Response

It has not been possible to contact the vendors.  Attempts were made on July 3, 2020 to contact eiss-dns@att.com, support@zacks.com, ipadmin@homedepot.com, teamdepotPR@homedepot.com and public_relations@homedepot.com.  No responses were received.
